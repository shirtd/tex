	abstract = {We introduce a statistic, the persistent homology transform (PHT), to model surfaces in ${\mathbb { R}}^3$ and shapes in ${\mathbb { R}}^2$. This statistic is a collection of persistence diagrams---multiscale topological summaries used extensively in topological data analysis. We use the PHT to represent shapes and execute operations such as computing distances between shapes or classifying shapes. We provide a constructive proof that the map from the space of simplicial complexes in ${\mathbb { R}}^3$ into the space spanned by this statistic is injective. This implies that we can use it to determine a metric on the space of piecewise linear shapes. Stability results justify that we can approximate this metric using finitely many persistence diagrams. We illustrate the utility of this statistic on simulated and real data.},

@article{adams15evasion,
	abstract = {Suppose that ball-shaped sensors wander in a bounded domain. A sensor does not know its location but does know when it overlaps a nearby sensor. We say that an evasion path exists in this sensor network if a moving intruder can avoid detection. In `Coordinate-free coverage in sensor networks with controlled boundaries via homology', Vin de Silva and Robert Ghrist give a necessary condition, depending only on the time-varying connectivity data of the sensors, for an evasion path to exist. Using zigzag persistent homology, we provide an equivalent condition that moreover can be computed in a streaming fashion. However, no method with time-varying connectivity data as input can give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an evasion path. Indeed, we show that the existence of an evasion path depends not only on the fibrewise homotopy type of the region covered by sensors but also on its embedding in spacetime. For planar sensors that also measure weak rotation and distance information, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an evasion path.},

	abstract = {In this paper we prove a special case of the transversal conjecture of Tverberg and Vrecica. We consider the case when the numbers of parts ri in this conjecture are powers of the same prime. We also prove some results on common transversals that generalize the classical nonembeddability theorems. We also prove an analogue of the colored Tverberg's theorem by Zivaljevic and Vrecica. Instead of multicolor simplices with a common point it gives multicolor simplices with a common m-transversal.},

	abstract = {The theory of secondary and fiber polytopes implies
         that regular (also called convex or coherent)
         triangulations of configurations with n points in R d
         have at least n Gamma d Gamma 1 geometric bistellar
         neighbors. Here we prove that, in fact, all
         triangulations of n points in R 2 have at least n Gamma
         3 geometric bistellar neighbors. In a similar way, we
         show that for three dimensional point configurations,
         in convex position and with no three points collinear,
         all triangulations have at least n Gamma 4 geometric
         bistellar flips. In contrast, we exhibit three
         dimensional point configurations, with a single
         interior point, having deficiency on the number of
         geometric bistellar flips. A lifting technique allows
         us to obtain a simplicial convex 4-polytope with less
         than n Gamma 5 neighbors. We also construct a family of
         point configurations in R 3 with arbitrarily large flip
